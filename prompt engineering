what is prompt engineering:
It combines artificial intelligence and human language understanding.

Professionals or reserchers work to create prompts or instructions that effectively guide AI systemsto produce expected outcome.

Prompt engineering is the method used in natural language processing(NLP) and machine language.

LLM-->Large Langauge Model
GPT-3,BERT-->They responses based on the prompts they receive.

Prompt engineering as giving direction to these models by crafting specific and concise prompts,we guide them to produce response we want.

prompt engineering is an art as it is a science.

prompt:A set of detailed guidelines given to LLM to do a task.
engineering:developing a task specific prompt iteratively.

prompt engineering --iterative process

idea--prompt(design)--result (give that it to your model)---test or feedfack--idea--and so on

BASICS OF PROMPT ENGINEERING:
=============================
prompts contains two parts:
1.parameters
2.structure

1.parameters:
1.Temperature:(0 to 1) for creative answer -->0.7 to 0.8,for normal set it to 0
Lower for creativity and deterministic results: Higher for diversity and factual Q/A

2.TOP P: Top probability
Control model determinisim;Low for factual,high for diverse.

3.Max length:
Manage response length.

Components of a good prompt:
===========================
Good prompt -->chatGPT or generative model gives you a good result/outcomes .and you have less feedback.

Instruction:
==========
A specific task or instruction you want the model to perform.

Context:
=======
Additional context that can steer the model to better perfomance.

Input Data:
==========
The input or question for that we need answer.

Output Indicater:
================
The type or format of the output.

Examples of components of the good prompt:
=========================================
1.Context:
"Act as a analyst" working for an OTT platform.You will have to perform sentiment analysis based on the feedback provided 
by the consumers on the movies and series put on the OTT platform.

2.Classify the feedback as neutral ,negative,pr positive ,where positive is promotor, negative means demoter,
and neutral means neither will promote nor will demote the contentt.

Example:
feedback1:I think the series was okay.
sentiment:Neutral
feedback2:The acting of each character in the series was awesome.
sentiment:Positive.

3.Input /output data:
Feedback:the storyline for the series was repetitive and abysmal(very bad).
sentiment.negative


How to write a good prompt:
==========================
#Define the goal: 
Tell chatGPT what you exactly want it to do.
#Detail out it format:
Specify the format in which you want your output.Eg.tables/paragraph,lists,with or without heading,listed in priorty order if any,etc.
#Create a Role:
Assign chatGPT a role to let it process your request from that specific point of view.Eg.Act as a anylists..etc.

#Clarify whol the audience is:(begginer,advanced,intermediate level,etc)
Specify the demographics for chatGPT to help it tailor its response appropriately.

#Give context:
Provide every possible information to chatGPT to help it understand the purpose of your request.,

#Give examples:
Share examples to let chatGPT learn form it and produce more accurate results.

#specify the style:
outline the tone,the communication style ,the brand identity and other details in your prompt for a suitable response.

#define the scope:
outlining a scope with further specifications besides giving a context and examples.will help charGPT operate within those parameters.(temperatures,top p)

#Apply restrictions:
Constraints or restrictions applied in your prompt will create the right boundaries for chatGPT to produce more relevant responses.
(output length,token length)


Different Prompt Patterns:
=========================
1.Persona pattern:
Act as X.DO the task Y.(Eg: As a Yoga teacher ,create a beginner -friendly routine for joint mobility.)

2.Audience Persona Pattern:
Explain X to me.Assume I'm Y.(Eg. Explain the importance of eating greens.Assume I'm a skeptical child.)

3.Visualization Generator Pattern:
Generate X that can be provided to tool Y for visualization.(Eg. generate a CSV that i can use in tableau to create a visualization.)

4.Recipe pattern:
Inorder to do X, i need to perform steps a,b,c. provide a complete sequence of steps for me while filling in any missing steps and removing redundant steps.

5.Template pattern:
I will provide a template ,with placeholders for content. fit the output with one or more placeholders that i list.
Eg.Generate a day -wise travel itinerary for visiting paris.
My place holders are
<day> for the day of the travel plan
<location> for the place to visit
<acitivity> for what to do in that place
<time> for the best part of the day to visit
Template:For <Day> visit <location> at <time> for <activity>
   

Common prompting errors:
=======================
1.Vague or Ambiguous prompts
2.Biased prompts
3.Lack of contextual information
4.Insufficient example or training data
5.Complext or confuding prompts
6.Not testing prompts thoroughly

Applications of prompt engineering:
==================================

-Retail and shopping

Hands on basics of prompt engineering:

Defining a good  prompt engineering:
===================================
1.Text summarization
2.code generation


Advanced prompt starttegies:
============================
#Zero-shot,:
Directly  instructing the model to perform a task without any additional examples.
#Few-Shot,:
Teaching with examples in the prompt.
#Chain of thought process:
Designed for logical thoughts.(blood relation etc....)
Asking to show its work or though process.
eg:
adding
2+2=4
15+4=19

input->3150+10500
what will be the answer
