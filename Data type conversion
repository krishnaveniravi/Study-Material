Data Type Conversion:
  Data type conversion in Python involves changing a value from one data type to another.
Also called as 'type casting'.

Implicit Type Conversion:
  automatically converts one data type into another during expression evaluation. 
  This usually happens when a smaller data type like int is combined with a larger one like float in an operation.
x = 10          # Integer
y = 10.6        # Float
z = x + y     

print("x:", type(x))
print("y:", type(y))
print("z =", z)
print("z :", type(z))

Output
x: <class 'int'>
y: <class 'float'>
z = 20.6
z : <class 'float'>

Explicit Type Conversion:
  manually convert the data type of a value using Python’s built-in functions.

  int() converts a value to an integer
  float() converts a value to a floating point number
  str() converts a value to a string
  bool() converts a value to a Boolean (True/False)
a = "55"  # String
b = int(s)             
print(a)
print(type(a))
