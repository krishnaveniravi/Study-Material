1.Python Program for word Guessing Game:
This program is a simple word-guessing game where the user has to guess the characters in a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts. 
The program provides feedback after each guess, helping the user to either complete the word or lose the game based on their guesses.
1. Importing the Random Module
2. Getting the User's Name, and Greeting the User
3. List of Words and Choosing a Random Word
4. Prompting the User to Guess
5. Initializing Guesses and Turns
6. The Main Game Loop
6.1. Checking Each Character in the Word
6.2. Checking if the User Has Won
6.4. Handling Incorrect Guesses
6.5. Checking if the User Has Lost
7. Ending the Game

#2.Rock Paper Scissor game:
In this game, the user gets the first chance to pick the option between Rock, paper, and scissors. 
After the computer select from the remaining two choices(randomly), the winner is decided as per the rules.
Winning Rules as follows:
Rock vs paper-> paper wins
Rock vs scissor-> Rock wins
paper vs scissor-> scissor wins.

Code Explanation:
1.The code starts by printing a message that states the rules of the game.
2.The first line in the code prints "Rock vs paper->paper wins."
3.This is because if you have a rock, and you play against someone who has a piece of paper, the rock will beat the paper.
4.The next line in the code prints "Rock vs scissor->Rock wins."
5.This is because if you have a rock, and you play against someone who has a scissors, the rock will beat the scissors.
6.The last line in the code prints "paper vs scissor->scissor wins."
7.This is because if you have a piece of paper, and you play against someone who has a scissors, then the piece of paper will beat the scissors.
8.The code will print the following output: Winning Rules of the Rock paper scissor game as follows: Rock vs paper->paper wins Rock vs scissor->Rock wins paper vs scissor->scissor wins
9.The code starts by asking the user for a choice.
10.The code then checks to see if the input is 1, 2, or 3.
11.If it is not one of those values, the code sets the choice_name variable to 'Rock' if choice == 1, 'paper' if choice == 2, and 'scissor' if choice == 3.
12.The next part of the code asks the user for their computer turn.
13.The code uses a random number generator to choose between 1, 2, and 3.
14.This value is stored in comp_choice_name.
15.Next, the code loops until comp_choice equals choice.
16.In each loop iteration, comp_choice will be randomly chosen from 1-3 and stored in comp_choice_name.
17.Once comp_choice equals choice, this means that the computer has chosen rock as its turn!
18.Finally, it prints out both choices so that everyone can see what happened (user choice is: Rock V/s paper; Computer choice is: Rock V/s scissor).
19.The code will ask the user for a choice between rock, paper and scissors.
20.Once the user enters their choice, the code will randomly choose one of those options as the computer's turn.
21.The code then prints out the chosen option and the user's choice.
22.Finally, it loops back to ask for another choice from the user.

import random
print('Welcome to the Rock paper scissor Game')
print('Winning Rules of the Rock paper scissor game as follows:')
print('Rock vs paper->paper wins')
print('Rock vs scissor->Rock wins')
print('paper vs scissor->scissor wins')

while True:
    print('Choices:\n 1.Rock\n 2.paper\n 3.scissor')
    choice=int(input('Enter Your Choice: '))
    while choice not in [1,2,3]:
        choice=int(input('Enter the Valid Choice: '))

    if choice==1:
        choice_Name='Rock'
    elif choice==2:
        choice_Name='paper'
    elif choice==3:
        choice_Name='scissor'

    print('User Choice is:',choice_Name)
    print("Now Computer's Turn")

    computer_choice=random.randint(1,3)

    if computer_choice == 1:
        comp_choice_name = 'Rock'
    elif computer_choice == 2:
        comp_choice_name = 'paper'
    elif computer_choice == 3:
        comp_choice_name = 'scissor'

    print('Computer Choice is:',comp_choice_name)
    print(choice_Name,'Vs',comp_choice_name)

    if choice_Name == comp_choice_name:
        result='Game Draw'
    elif (computer_choice == 1 and choice==2) or (choice==1 and computer_choice==2):
        result='paper'
    elif (computer_choice == 1 and choice==3) or (choice==3 and computer_choice==1):
        result='Rock'
    elif (computer_choice == 2 and choice==3) or (choice==2 and computer_choice==3):
        result='scissor'

    if result=='Game Draw':
        print("It's a tie!")
    elif result == choice_Name:
        print('User Wins!')

3.Implementation:

This is a simple Hangman game using Python programming language. 
Beginners can use this as a small project to boost their programming skills and understanding logic.  

1.The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. 
2.The random module will provide this ability, so line 1 in program imports it.
3.The Game: Here, a random word (a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.
4.When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. 
In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over. 
5.For convenience, we have given length of word + 2 chances. 
For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 5 + 2 = 7 chances, as mango is a five-letter word.

import random
from collections import Counter

words=['plum','melon','papaya','kiwi','apple','mango','cherry','banana']
word=random.choice(words)

chances=len(word)+2
letter_guessed=''

print('Welcome to the Hangman Game!')
print()
print('Guess the word!:Hint:word is a name of fruit')

for i in word:
    print('_',end='')
print()
print(f'You have {chances} chances left')

while chances>0:
    chances-=1
    try:
        guess=str(input('Enter the character to guess the word: ')).lower()
    except:
        print('Enter only a letter')
        continue
    if (not guess.isalpha()) or len(guess)>1:
        print('Enter the single alphabet character')
        continue
    if guess in letter_guessed:
        print('You have already guessed this letter')
        continue

    if guess in word:
        k=word.count(guess)
        for i in range(k):
            letter_guessed+=guess
    for char in word:
        if char in letter_guessed:
            print(char,end='')
        else:
            print('_',end=' ')
    print()
    if Counter(letter_guessed)== Counter(word):
        print('You guessed correct word!')
        print('The word is:',word)
        print('Congratualations,You won!')
        break
if (chances<=0) and Counter(letter_guessed)!= Counter(word):
    print('You ran out of chances,better luck next time!')
    print('The word is:',word)

5.Python - Cows and Bulls game:

Cows and Bulls is a pen and paper code-breaking game usually played between 2 players. 
In this, a player tries to guess a secret code number chosen by the second player. The rules are as follows:

#A player will create a secret code, usually a 4-digit number.  This number should have no repeated digits.
#Another player makes a guess (4 digit number) to crack the secret number. Upon making a guess, 2 hints will be provided- Cows and Bulls.
#Bulls indicate the number of correct digits in the correct position and cows indicates the number of correct digits in the wrong position. 
For example, if the secret code is 1234 and the guessed number is 1246 then we have 2 BULLS 
(for the exact matches of digits 1 and 2) and 1 COW (for the match of digit 4 in the wrong position)
#The player keeps on guessing until the secret code is cracked. The player who guesses in the minimum number of tries wins.

#Constraint: The secret code and the guessed code should be of 4-digits (between 1000 and 9999) and have no repeated numbers.

import random

#secret number without repeatation

    list_num=[int(i) for i in str(sec_num)]

while turns>0:
    guess=int(input('Enter the number(1000-9999):'))
    turns-=1
    if (guess<1000 or guess>9999) or (not notduplicate(guess)):
        print('Please enter the valid number without repeatation')
        continue
    bulls_cows=[0,0]
    sec_num_li=[int(i) for i in str(sec_num)]
    guess_li=[int(j) for j in str(guess)]
    for k,l in zip(sec_num_li,guess_li):
        if l in sec_num_li:
            if l==k:
                bulls_cows[0]+=1
            else:
