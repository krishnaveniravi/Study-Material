Python if...else

python conditions and if statement:

python supports usual logical conditions from mathematics:
    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b

if statement written using ===>if keyword
a=23
b=45
if a<b:
  print('a is smaller than b') #a is smaller than b

If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):
a=23
b=45
if a<b:
print('a is smaller than b') #IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 3
-=======================
elif:
If the previous conditions were not true, then elif condition 
a=4
b=5
if a==b:
  print('a and b are equal')
elif a<b:
  print('a is less than b') #a is less than b
========================
else:
else keyword catches when previous conditions which isn;t true
a=10
b=30
if a>b:
  print('a is greater than b')
elif a==b:
  print('a and b are equal')
else:
  print('b is greater than a')  #b is greater than a
=========================
else without the elif:
a=4
b=5
if a>b:
  print('a is greater than b')
else:
  print('b is greater than a') #b is greater than a
==========================
Short Hand If:

only one statement to execute,
a=4
b=3
if a>b:print('a is greater than b') #a is greater than b

Short Hand If ... Else: Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions::::
only one statement to execute,
a=4
b=10
print(a)if a>b else print(b)  #10Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions
===============================================
To combine conditional statements:logical operators used:
and,or,not

and: if both conditions are true returns true
Test if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a:
a=8
b=4
c=5
if a>b and c>b:
  print('both conditions are True') #both conditions are True

or:if both conditions are true returns true
any one of the condition is true ==>true
Atleast any one of the condition is true
a=8
b=4
c=5
if a>b or b>c:
  print('Atleast anyone of the condition is true') #Atleast anyone of the condition is true

not:
it used to reverse the result of the conditional statement
a=4
b=8
if not a>b:
  print('a is not greater than b') #a is not greater than b
===============================
Nested If:
if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
x = 41
if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")

pass:
we can use pass keyword to avoid error
a=4
b=5
if a>b:
  pass
