Python if...else

python conditions and if statement:

python supports usual logical conditions from mathematics:
    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b

if statement written using ===>if keyword
a=23
b=45
if a<b:
  print('a is smaller than b') #a is smaller than b

If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):
a=23
b=45
if a<b:
print('a is smaller than b') #IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 3
-=======================
elif:
If the previous conditions were not true, then elif condition 
a=4
b=5
if a==b:
  print('a and b are equal')
elif a<b:
  print('a is less than b') #a is less than b
========================
else:
else keyword catches when previous conditions which isn;t true
a=10
b=30
if a>b:
  print('a is greater than b')
elif a==b:
  print('a and b are equal')
else:
  print('b is greater than a')  #b is greater than a
=========================
else without the elif:
a=4
b=5
if a>b:
  print('a is greater than b')
else:
  print('b is greater than a') #b is greater than a
==========================
Short Hand If:

only one statement to execute,
a=4
b=3
if a>b:print('a is greater than b') #a is greater than b

Short Hand If ... Else: Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions::::
only one statement to execute,
a=4
b=10
print(a)if a>b else print(b)  #10Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions
===============================================
To combine conditional statements:logical operators used:
and,or,not

and: if both conditions are true returns true
Test if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a:
a=8
b=4
c=5
if a>b and c>b:
  print('both conditions are True') #both conditions are True

or:if both conditions are true returns true
any one of the condition is true ==>true
Atleast any one of the condition is true
a=8
b=4
c=5
if a>b or b>c:
  print('Atleast anyone of the condition is true') #Atleast anyone of the condition is true

not:
it used to reverse the result of the conditional statement
a=4
b=8
if not a>b:
  print('a is not greater than b') #a is not greater than b
===============================
Nested If:
if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
x = 41
if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")

pass:
we can use pass keyword to avoid error
a=4
b=5
if a>b:
  pass
=========================================================================
PYTHON LOOP:
1===>while loop
2===>for loop

while loop:
Execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
while loop requires relevant variable ready ie: i=1.in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i

Print i as long as i is less than 6:
i=0  ===>i -->indexing variable
while i<6:
    print(i)
    i+=1
output:
0
1
2
3
4
5
Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
while loop requires relevant variable ready ie: i=1.in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i
--------------------------------------
break statement:
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
Exit the loop when i is 3:
i=1
while i<6:
    print(i)
    if i==3:
        break
    i+=1
output:
1
2
3
----------------------------------------
continue statement:
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
i=0
while i<6:
    i += 1
    if i==3:
        continue
    print(i)
output:
1
2
4
5
6
------------------------------
else statement:
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

Print a message once the condition is false:
i=1
while i<6:
    print(i)
    i+=1
else:
    print('i is no longer less than 6')
output:
1
2
3
4
5
i is no longer less than 6
=========================================
for loops:
==>for loop is used for iterating over a sequence.
ie)either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
===>the for loop doesn't require index variable assignment beforehand==========>important

Print each car in a car list:
car=['tata','bmw','ford','audi']
for i in car:
    print(i)
output:
tata
bmw
ford
audi
-------------
looping through string:
name='jhon'
for i in name:
    print(i)
output:
j
h
o
n
-----------------
break Statement:
    The break statement-->we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items.
car=['tata','bmw','ford','audi','MG']
for i in car:
    print(i)
    if i=='ford':
        break
output:
tata
bmw
ford

Exit the loop when i is "ford", but this time the break comes before the print:
car=['tata','bmw','ford','audi','MG']
for i in car:
    if i=='ford':
            break    
    print(i)
output:
tata
bmw
---------------------------
continue Statement:
with continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with next

Do not print ford:
car=['tata','bmw','ford','audi','MG']
for i in car:
    if i=='ford':
            continue
    print(i)
output:
tata
bmw
---------------------------
range() function:
range() function returns the sequence of numbers 
starting from 0 by default,increment by 1 by default and end at a specified number

for i in range(6):
    print(i)
output:
0
1
2
3
4
5
Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.

Using the start parameter:
for i in range(3,7):
    print(i,end=' ')  #3 4 5 6 

Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):
for i in range(2,20,3):
    print(i,end=' ') #2 5 8 11 14 17 
-------------------------------------
Else in For Loop:

else keyword is used in for loop to specifies that block of code to be executed when the loop is finished.

Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:
for i in range(6):
    print(i,end=' ')
else:
    print('Finally finished')
output=0 1 2 3 4 5 Finally finished

Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.

Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:
for x in range(6):
    if x==3;
        break
    print(x)
else:
    print('finished finally')
-------------------------------------------
Nested loop:
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

Print each car for every color:
car=['tata','bmw','ford','audi']
color=['red','blue','white']
for i in car:
    for x in color:
        print(i,x)

tata red
tata blue
tata white
bmw red
bmw blue
bmw white
ford red
ford blue
ford white
audi red
audi blue
audi white
-------------------
pass statement:
for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content,
put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

for i in range(9):
    pass
