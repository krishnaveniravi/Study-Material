#2. Inheritance and its types:
Inheritance:
In heritance in python allows a class (called childclass/sub class) can inherit the attributes and methods of another class (called parent class/super class)
without need to rewrite them again.

Five types:
  1.Single inheritance
  2.Multiple inheritance
  3.Hierarchical inheritance
  4.Multilevel inheritance
  5.Hybrid Inheritance

1.Single Inheritance:

  Single inheritance enables the derived class to inherit the attributes and methods of single parent class.

example program:
  #Single inheritance
  class father: #parent class
      def bike(self):
          print("Father owns a bike")
  class daughter(father): #child class or derived class
      def car(self):
          print("Daughter owns a car")
  tour=daughter() #object created
  tour.car() #access daughter class method
  tour.bike() #accessing father class method
#################################3
2.Multiple Inheritance:
  A class can derived from more than one base class is called multiple inhritance.

example program:
  class father: #parent class1
      def bike(self):
          print("Father owns a bike")
  
  class mother: #parent class2
      def scooter(self):
          print("Mother owns a scooter")
  
  class daughter(father,mother): #child class or derived class from ore than one base class
      def car(self):
          print("Daughter owns a car")
  tour=daughter() #object created
  tour.car() #access daughter class method
  tour.bike() #accessing father class method
  tour.scooter() #accessing mother class method
##################################

3.Hierarchical inheritance
  When more than one child class derived from the one base class is called Hierarchical inheritance.

example program:
  #Hierarchical inheritance:
  class father: #parent class1
      fathername="Ravi"
      def bike(self):
          print("Father owns a bike")
  
  class son(father): #child class 1
      def scooter(self):
          print("Son owns a scooter")
          print(f"Father Name: {self.fathername}")
  
  class daughter(father): #child class 2
      def car(self):
          print("Daughter owns a car")
          print(f"Father Name: {self.fathername}")
  tour=daughter()
  shopping=son()
  tour.car()
  tour.bike()
  shopping.scooter()
  shopping.bike()
#########################################

4.Multilevel Inheritance:
  In multilevel inheritance ,the features of base class and derived class is further inherited into new derived class.
garnd parent==>parent==>child

example program:
  class grandfather:
    def grand(self):
        print("Grandfather name is Tata")
  class father(grandfather):
      def parent(self):
          print("Father name is Naval Tata")
  class child(father):
      def son(self):
          print("Child name is Ratan Tata")
  
  grandchild=child()
  grandchild.son()
  grandchild.parent()
  grandchild.grand()
###############################################3

5.Hybrid Inheritance:

  Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. 
  It uses a mix like single, multiple, or multilevel inheritance within the same program. 

example program:
class school:
    schoolname="ABC Higher Secondary School"
    def method1(self):
        print(self.schoolname)
class student1(school):
    studentname1="Abi"
    def method2(self):
        print(self.schoolname)
class student2(school):
    studentname2="Selvi"
    def method3(self):
        print(self.schoolname)
class student3(student1,student2,school):
    def method4(self):
        print(f"Friend Name1: {self.studentname1}")
        print("Friend school name:", self.schoolname)
        print(f"Friend Name2: {self.studentname2}")
        print("Friend school name:", self.schoolname)
object1=school()
object1.method1()

object2=student3()
object2.method4()
#####################################

3.Static method vs class method
staticmethod:
This is defined using @staticmethod decorator and do not take a reference to the class as the first parameter.With out using self.
Usefull for tasks that do not depend on instance-specific or class-specific data.
So we can't access the method and attributes of class and object.

example program:
  class arithmetic:
      @staticmethod
      def add(a,b):
          return a+b
      @staticmethod
      def sub(a,b):
          return a-b
  calci=arithmetic()
  print(calci.add(1,5))
  print(calci.sub(5,2))
=================
classmethod:
Class methods are associated with the class rather than instances. 
They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and take the class itself as the first parameter.
We can only access the attributes and methods of class.

example program:
class mathoperation:
    a=10
    b=12
    def __init__(self,operation):
        self.operation=operation
        print(self.operation)
    
    @classmethod
    def add(cls):
        return cls.a+cls.b

cal=mathoperation("addition")
print(f"{cal.a}+{cal.b}=",cal.add())
####################################

4.explain constructor and program

Constructor:
  Constructor is the method which is called automatically after the object created.
__init__ used as a constructor to initialize the object.
types:
1.Default Constructor
  A default constructor does not take any parameters other than self. It initializes the object with default attribute values.
example program:
  class Vehicles:
      def __init__(self):
          self.vehicle="Car"
          self.make="TATA"
          self.model="PUNCH"
          self.price="8.5l"
  car=Vehicles()
  print("Vehicle:",car.vehicle)
  print("Make:", car.make)
  print("Model:", car.model)
  print("Price:" ,car.price)
###############
2.Parameterized Constructor
  A parameterized constructor accepts arguments to initialize the object's attributes with specific values.

example program:
class Vehicles:
    def __init__(self,vehicle,make,model,price):
        self.vehicle=vehicle
        self.make=make
        self.model=model
        self.price=price
car=Vehicles("car","TATA","PUNCH","8.5L")
print("Vehicle:",car.vehicle)
print("Make:", car.make)
print("Model:", car.model)
print("Price:" ,car.price)
######################################
5.explain self and program
self:
  self is used to represent the instance/object of the class.
  With this we can access the methods and attributes of the class in python.
  self is the first parameter of the method in the class.
  It is not a keyword,we can used any name in the place of self.

example program:
class subject:
    def __init__(self,sub1,sub2):
        self.sub1=sub1
        self.sub2=sub2
Teacher=subject("Math","Science")
print("Subject1:",Teacher.sub1)
print("Subject2:",Teacher.sub2)
